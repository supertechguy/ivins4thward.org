“He is risen” was the angelic message of the first Easter. As we celebrate Easter Sunday on April 9, 2023, the message is the same. Jesus Christ is indeed risen.

God gave us the gift of His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ who suffered, bled, and died for all. Three days later, He rose again, claiming victory over death.

We proclaim that Jesus is our resurrected Savior and our Redeemer. He is the light, the life, and the hope of the world. Following Him brings happiness in this life and eternal life in the world to come.
