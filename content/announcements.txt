-Every 2nd Tuesday of each month is designated as Ivins 4th Ward "Ward Temple Day", our next date is upon us, this Tuesday 7/9/24. The 6:00pm Endowment Session @ the St. George Temple is the preffered session, but many may choose to attend the temple at an earlier time that day. That being said, everyone is invited to gather for treats after the 6:00pm session (approx. 8:15pm) at Brother & Sister Merrell's home. 231 E. Desert Rose Way. We hope to see you in the temple, or at the Merrell's Tuesday. 

-Missionary Tip
Many of these messages have focused on being good neighbors and becoming friends, especially with your neighbors. But getting the missionary spirit can happen with those who are already members as well. Here are a couple of things you could do to develop a missionary spirit in your home. First, use Preach My Gospel in your family home evenings. There are great topics for discussion that can increase testimonies in the family. Second, if you notice someone was not at church, email/text a summary of what was taught to that individual. You could even include your testimony of what you learned. So don't think that missionary work is only accomplished with those who are not memebers. Any opportunity to share what you know helps the work progress.
