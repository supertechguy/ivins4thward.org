"Despite our every effort, you and I wonâ€™t heal everyone, but each of us can be the one who can make a difference for good in the life of someone." "-I assure you: it is sufficient to give or to do what you are able and then to allow Christ to magnify your effort."


By Elder Ian S. Ardern
Of the Seventy
