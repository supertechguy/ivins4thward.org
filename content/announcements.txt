-Exploring Senior Missions
“President Nelson has asked “seasoned” members to “get on your knees and ask Heavenly Father if the time is right to serve a mission.” To assist in the decision process, the Ivins Stake Presidency is sponsoring a 5-week course called “Exploring Senior Missions” that has been designed by the Church to answer questions about senior missionary service opportunities available locally or away from home and how to prepare.  The course will begin on Sunday, January 21st @ 4:00 pm in the Ivins Stake Center Relief Society Room.  We invite you to come learn all you can so you can make the best decision for your situation!”. The course will begin on Sunday, January 21st @ 4:00 pm in the Ivins Stake Center, (290 E 1060 S, Ivins, UT) Relief Society Room. Each class will last approximately 90 minutes.

-Dear Parents of the Ivins 4th Ward Youth,
If your youtb will be 14 years old or older by December 31, 2024 then it’s time to get stoked for 2024 FSY! I thought it was time we share some pre-registration how-to's and what not. Please reach out to me if you get stuck or have any questions! We'll be having a "Before You Go" activity on February 24, starting at 1 pm and finishing off with a regional dance! Please add that to your calendar for the youth! 
Thanks for all you do! Have a great and Happy New Year!

- Notice about Email/Phone Communication  
To simplify communication with members, recording and displaying "household" phone numbers in the Church Membership Records (i.e., LCR, Tools), will be discontinued.  Only a Member's individual phone number and email will be recorded and diplayed.  In order to minimize potential loss of contact information, Church HQ will be transfering information (primarily using Head of Household Information).  If you find issues with your contact information, or stop receiving communication, contact the Ward Clerk, Brother Stu Schnabel.  

-Missionary Tip
It's a new year and with it comes new resolutions. Make a resolution to get to know your neighbors. Say hello to every neighbor you see. Maybe even find out about hobbies and intersts. We will feel more confident in inviting someone when we have a strong friendship with them. Get to know the neighbors.
