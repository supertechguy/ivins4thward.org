"The Savior invites all to “serve him with all your heart.” When we choose to do each thing the Lord has asked us to do—such as keeping the commandments, partaking of the sacrament, worshipping in the temple, and serving others—with a sincere heart and with real intent, each act of service and worship becomes a powerful spiritual experience that strengthens our faith and testimony and fills our hearts with joy and love for God and our fellow man."

By Elder Ronald M. Barcellos
Of the Seventy General Conference, October 2025
