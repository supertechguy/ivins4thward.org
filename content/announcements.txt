-Exploring Senior Missions
“President Nelson has asked “seasoned” members to “get on your knees and ask Heavenly Father if the time is right to serve a mission.” To assist in the decision process, the Ivins Stake Presidency is sponsoring a 4-week course called “Exploring Senior Missions” that has been designed by the Church to answer questions about senior missionary service opportunities available locally or away from home, and how to prepare. The course will begin on Sunday, March 9th @ 4:00 pm in the Ivins Stake Center Relief Society Room. We invite you to come learn all you can so you can prayerfully make  the best decision for your situation!

-“The Lord has declared, “It is my purpose to provide for my
saints” (D&C 104:15). This revelation is a promise from the Lord
that He will provide temporal blessings and open the door of
self-reliance, which is the ability for us to provide the necessities
of life for ourselves and our family members.”
