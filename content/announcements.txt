- Missionary Tip:  
Invite someone to a temple open house!  Now that you have prayed about who to invite,  now is the time to follow through.  The St. George Temple open house begins this week.  It will be a great missionary tool to share what is inside such an iconic building that is so important to the salvation of mankind. Make the invitation, the appointment and GO!
