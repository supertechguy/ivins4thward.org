"My beloved friends, our prayers are our sweetest hour,12 our most “sincere desire,”13 our simplest, purest form of worship.14 We should pray individually, in our families, and in congregations of all sizes.15 We are to employ prayer as a shield against temptation,16 and if there be any time we feel not to pray, we can be sure that hesitancy does not come from God, who yearns to communicate with His children at any and all times."
