"Let us as a people become a true light on the hill—a light that “cannot be hid."  Let us show that there is a peaceful, respectful way to resolve complex issues and an enlightened way to work out disagreements. As you demonstrate the charity that true followers of Jesus Christ manifest, the Lord will magnify your efforts beyond your loftiest imagination."

By President Russell M. Nelson
President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
