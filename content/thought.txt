While He was on the earth, Jesus taught the way to be happy, find peace, and return to live with God. His gospel stil1 applies today. If you follow Jesus by applying these five lessons He taught, your life will be more joyful and full of meaning.

1 - Love God and your neighbor
When asked which commandment was the most important, Jesus said, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself” (Matthew 22:37–39).
When you replace hate with love, and anger with kindness, you’ll feel closer to God and notice more peace in your life.

2 - Live the Golden Rule
Jesus taught the Golden Rule during His Sermon on the Mount: “Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them” (Matthew 7:12). In other words, treat others the way you want to be treated. As you do so, you will strengthen your relationships and be happier.

3 - Have faith in Jesus Christ
In John 3:16 we read, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” Having faith in Jesus Christ means believing in Him and His teachings. Doing so will bless you in this life and in the life to come.

4 - Communicate sincerely with God
Jesus taught by example that we should pray to God, our Heavenly Father, often. God loves you. He stands ready to help you. Communicate with Him through prayer, express gratitude, and ask for things you need.

5 - Freely forgive
While Jesus was on the earth, Peter asked Him, “Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?” Jesus responded, “I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven” (Matthew 18:21–22). When we freely offer forgiveness to others, we can invite more peace and forgiveness into our own lives.
