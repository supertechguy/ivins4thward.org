- Notice about Email/Phone Communication  
To simplify communication with members, recording and displaying "household" phone numbers in the Church Membership Records (i.e., LCR, Tools), will be discontinued.  Only a Member's individual phone number and email will be recorded and diplayed.  In order to minimize potential loss of contact information, Church HQ will be transfering information (primarily using Head of Household Information).  If you find issues with your contact information, or stop receiving communication, contact the Ward Clerk, Brother Stu Schnabel. 

- Service on Christmas Eve will be Sacrament meeting only.
