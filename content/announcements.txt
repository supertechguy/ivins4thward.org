- Ward Christmas Party -
“For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior. Which is Christ the Lord.” Luke 2:11

As the wisemen traveled far to see their Savior, and to bring Him gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh, we invite you to join us in celebrating His birth at the ward Christmas party.

You will have the opportunity to consider what you would like to give to the Savior as a gift this Christmas and to wrap that gift to take home. You will also have the chance to take a picture at the manger if you choose. Costumes will be provided.

Saturday December 17th at the Stake Center
9am-10am-Breakfast and Program
10am-10:30am-Gifts to the Savior and Pictures
