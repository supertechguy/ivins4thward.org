James 1:22 “But be ye doers of the word, and not 
hearers only…”

Are You Still Willing?
by Elder Kevin W. Pearson of the Seventy

The Church is a gathering place for imperfect individuals 
who love God and who are willing to follow the Lord 
Jesus Christ. That willingness is rooted in the reality that 
Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. This divine 
truth can be known only by the power of the Holy Ghost. 
Therefore, our willingness is directly proportionate to the 
amount of time we commit to be in holy places where 
the influence of the Holy Ghost is present.
The importance we place on our Sabbath day 
observance, paying an honest tithe, holding a current 
temple recommend, attending the temple, and honoring 
our sacred temple covenants are all powerful indicators 
of our willingness and evidence of our commitment. Are 
we willing to put forth more than a superficial effort into 
strengthening our faith in Christ?
Heavenly Father loves us perfectly, but that love comes 
with great expectations. He expects us to willingly place 
the Savior at the very center of our lives. The Savior is 
our perfect example of willingness to submit to the 
Father in all things. He is “the way, the truth, and the 
life.” He willingly atoned for our sins. He willingly eases 
our burdens, calms our fears, gives us strength, and 
brings peace and understanding to our hearts in times of 
distress and grief.
If our spiritual foundation is built solidly on Jesus Christ, 
we will not fall and we need not fear. (Oct.2022 Conf.)
