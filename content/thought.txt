"My dear brothers and sisters, my beloved friends, dear and precious teachers—and you’re all teachers; we all are teachers—thank you for your faithfulness and for your desires to do good. Thank you for the many hours you have spent preparing, ministering to, and teaching others about the gospel joyfully.

I invite you to study the new guide Teaching in the Savior’s Way and use the self-evaluation to remind you of your purpose.

By laying hold upon the word of God and teaching others to do the same—by teaching in the Savior’s way—we show our love for God and for our fellow men and fellow human beings. And as we walk that strait and narrow course, we take part in that holiest of callings to lead our own immortal souls and the souls of others towards the “right hand of God in the kingdom of heaven, to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and with Jacob, and with all our holy fathers, to go no more out.”18

May God bless you, my fellow teachers, my dear friends, my fellow servants, for your sincere labors to teach in the Savior’s name. In the holy name of the greatest teacher of all time, in the name of our Master, in the name of Jesus the Christ, amen."
