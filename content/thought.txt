"Each of us, as a beloved son or daughter of God, makes our own sacred covenants with God. We do so as an individual, in our own name, one by one. This covenantal connection with God gives each of us power, hope, and promise. These covenants can change our very natures, sanctify our desires and actions, and help us put off the natural man or natural woman as we yield to the enticings of the Holy Spirit."
