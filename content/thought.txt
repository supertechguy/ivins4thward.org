"There are remarkable blessings in sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ. The scriptures speak of joy and peace, forgiveness of sins, protection from temptations, and sustaining power from God. Looking beyond this mortal life, we will be prepared to share the gospel with those 'in darkness and under the bondage of sin in the great world of the spirits of the dead.' (See D&C 138:57)."
