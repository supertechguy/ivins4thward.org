“As we know, anything broken can be mended through Jesus Christ. For this reason, please consider this invitation from President Russell M. Nelson: 'Now, if you have stepped off the path, may I invite you with all the hope in my heart to please come back. Whatever your concerns, whatever your challenges, there is a place for you in this, the Lord’s Church. You and generations yet unborn will be blessed by your actions now to return to the covenant path.'”

Elder Carlos A. Godoy
