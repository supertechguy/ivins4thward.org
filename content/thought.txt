In his wretched experience in Liberty Jail, the Prophet Joseph Smith prayed fervently for relief. How did the Lord answer those prayers? By changing the Prophet's perspective! "All these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (Doctrine and Covenants 122:7). So we, to, will be able to endure our trials by viewing them as the Lord would see them from His celestial and eternal perspective. - President Russell M. Nelson
