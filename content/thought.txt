"As we strive to “be one,” even as Jesus Christ is one with the Father (John 17:21), we must “put … on the Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 13:14).  We can be sanctified as, grace by grace, we learn and make our own the attributes of Jesus Christ—to love more fully, forgive more easily, judge less readily, serve and sacrifice more willingly, exemplify compassion more deeply and more often."
