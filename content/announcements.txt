-“The Lord has declared, “It is my purpose to provide for my
saints” (D&C 104:15). This revelation is a promise from the Lord
that He will provide temporal blessings and open the door of
self-reliance, which is the ability for us to provide the necessities
of life for ourselves and our family members.”

-Every 2nd Tuesday of each month is designated as Ivins 4th Ward "Ward Temple Day", our next date is upon us, Tuesday 9/10/24. The 6:00pm Endowment Session @ the St. George Temple is the preffered session, but many may choose to attend the temple at an earlier time that day. That being said, everyone is invited to gather for treats after the 6:00pm session (approx. 7:45pm) at The Nelson's, 243 E Desert Rose Way.

-Missionary Tip
Christ taught: Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed...(D&C 11:21). Before we can share our testimony with others, we need to strengthen our testimony. As a missionary tip, look for ways to build up your testimony. Maybe it's increasing your time in Come Follow Me. Maybe you could study and prepare a talk on the Savior or His atonement.
Maybe there is a subject that you want to know more about.
Whatever it is, study it, and when you are done, share your thoughts with a friend or on social media, or maybe the bishopric will ask you to speak.
Who knows. But first, obtain the word, then share it.
