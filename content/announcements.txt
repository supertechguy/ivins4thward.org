-Dear Parents of the Ivins 4th Ward Youth,
If your youth will be 14 years old or older by December 31, 2024 then it’s time to get stoked for 2024 FSY! I thought it was time we share some pre-registration how-to's and what not. Please reach out to me if you get stuck or have any questions! 

- Notice about Email/Phone Communication  
To simplify communication with members, recording and displaying "household" phone numbers in the Church Membership Records (i.e., LCR, Tools), will be discontinued.  Only a Member's individual phone number and email will be recorded and diplayed.  In order to minimize potential loss of contact information, Church HQ will be transfering information (primarily using Head of Household Information). If you find issues with your contact information, or stop receiving communication, contact the Ward Clerk, Brother Stu Schnabel.  

-Missionary Tip
We have spent the last few months getting to know our nieghbors. Let's go a step further now and do something with them. It could be as simple as sharing some ice cream to having a game night. Those neighobrs who don't know us very well might enjoy knowing that we like having fun! That may open doors to furtuer invitations to ward activites. So, decided on a favorite game and treats and invite some friends. Have fun!
