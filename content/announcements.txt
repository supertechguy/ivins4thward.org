-Every 2nd Tuesday of each month is designated as Ivins 4th Ward "Ward Temple Day", our next date is upon us, this Tuesday 7/9/24. The 6:00pm Endowment Session @ the St. George Temple is the preffered session, but many may choose to attend the temple at an earlier time that day. That being said, everyone is invited to gather for treats after the 6:00pm session (approx. 8:15pm) at Brother & Sister Merrell's home. 231 E. Desert Rose Way. We hope to see you in the temple, or at the Merrell's Tuesday. 

-Missionary Tip
We have spent the last few months getting to know our nieghbors. Let's go a step further now and do something with them. It could be as simple as sharing some ice cream to having a game night. Those neighobrs who don't know us very well might enjoy knowing that we like having fun! That may open doors to furtuer invitations to ward activites. So, decided on a favorite game and treats and invite some friends. Have fun!
