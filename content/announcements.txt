-Exploring Senior Missions
“President Nelson has asked “seasoned” members to “get on your knees and ask Heavenly Father if the time is right to serve a mission.” To assist in the decision process, the Ivins Stake Presidency is sponsoring a 5-week course called “Exploring Senior Missions” that has been designed by the Church to answer questions about senior missionary service opportunities available locally or away from home and how to prepare.  The course will begin on Sunday, January 21st @ 4:00 pm in the Ivins Stake Center Relief Society Room.  We invite you to come learn all you can so you can make the best decision for your situation!”. The course will begin on Sunday, January 21st @ 4:00 pm in the Ivins Stake Center, (290 E 1060 S, Ivins, UT) Relief Society Room. Each class will last approximately 90 minutes.

Please reach out to me if you get stuck or have any questions! We'll be having a "Before You Go" activity on March 2nd, starting at 1 pm and finishing off with a regional dance! Please add that to your calendar for the youth! 
Thanks for all you do! Have a great and Happy New Year!

- Notice about Email/Phone Communication  
To simplify communication with members, recording and displaying "household" phone numbers in the Church Membership Records (i.e., LCR, Tools), will be discontinued.  Only a Member's individual phone number and email will be recorded and diplayed.  In order to minimize potential loss of contact information, Church HQ will be transfering information (primarily using Head of Household Information).  If you find issues with your contact information, or stop receiving communication, contact the Ward Clerk, Brother Stu Schnabel.  

-Missionary Tip
Spring is upon us and we naturally tend to spend more time outside. Whether enjoying the sunshine or trying to get the yard spruced up, look around. Your neighbors are probably doing the same. Say "hello" to them. Give a friendly wave. Call them by name. If you don't know thier name, introduce yourself. It's much easier to invite people to things when you have a friendship established. Your challenge is to say hello to your neighbors at least one a week.
