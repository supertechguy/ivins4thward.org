"When I read prophetic promises of His birth—especially during the Christmas season—I feel the Holy Ghost witness again that Jesus Christ is the Messiah. As I study the Savior’s words and His life, I come to know Him and love Him for what He has done for each of us. The spirit of love is the spirit of Christmas.

“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life” (John 3:16).

The gift of the Son of God is a priceless gift. He is the gift that lights our way and lifts us. He is the gift that sustains us through the difficult days of our mortal journey. He is the gift that offers divine love, lasting hope, and true joy."

The Promised Messiah, By President Henry B. Eyring, Second Counselor in the First Presidency
