"In these last days, perhaps our greatest work will be with our loved ones—good people living in a wicked world. Our hope changes the way they see themselves and who they really are. And through this lens of love, they’ll see who they will become."


Sister Tamara W. Runia
First Counselor in the Young Women General Presidency
