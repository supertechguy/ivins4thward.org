- Missionary Tip:  
Thinking about sharing the gospel? Don't know where to start? Here is a simple thing to do: PRAY for the opportunity.  This has to be the starting point. We have an opportunity coming up with the temple open house to let our friends and neighbors see what the temple looks like. Pray for inspiration on who you can take with you. Then follow your promptings and you will be doing Missionary work!
