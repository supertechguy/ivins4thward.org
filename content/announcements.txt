-Missionary Tip
We have spent the last few months getting to know our nieghbors. Let's go a step further now and do something with them. It could be as simple as sharing some ice cream to having a game night. Those neighobrs who don't know us very well might enjoy knowing that we like having fun! That may open doors to furtuer invitations to ward activites. So, decided on a favorite game and treats and invite some friends. Have fun!
