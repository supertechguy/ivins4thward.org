- Notice about Email/Phone Communication  
To simplify communication with members, recording and displaying "household" phone numbers in the Church Membership Records (i.e., LCR, Tools), will be discontinued.  Only a Member's individual phone number and email will be recorded and diplayed.  In order to minimize potential loss of contact information, Church HQ will be transfering information (primarily using Head of Household Information).  If you find issues with your contact information, or stop receiving communication, contact the Ward Clerk, Brother Stu Schnabel.

- Missionary Tip:  
Invite someone to a temple open house!  Now that you have prayed about who to invite,  now is the time to follow through.  The St. George Temple open house begins this week.  It will be a great missionary tool to share what is inside such an iconic building that is so important to the salvation of mankind. Make the invitation, the appointment and GO!
