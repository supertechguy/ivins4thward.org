"When we come unto Jesus Christ, He promises us a remission of our sins, a “newness of life” (Romans 6:4), and “rest unto [our] souls” (Matthew 11:29). Ultimately, He promises us eternal life with Him, His Father, His devoted disciples, and our righteous family members forever.

In a future day, we will kneel at His feet. On that day, our souls will rejoice when He fulfills all His promises to those who have come unto Him with “full purpose of heart” (3 Nephi 18:32), grown in their love for Him, and sought to feel His divine presence throughout their lives."
