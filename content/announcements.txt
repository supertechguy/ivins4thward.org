-Missionary Tip
Christ taught: Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed...(D&C 11:21). Before we can share our testimony with others, we need to strengthen our testimony. As a missionary tip, look for ways to build up your testimony. Maybe it's increasing your time in Come Follow Me. Maybe you could study and prepare a talk on the Savior or His atonement.
Maybe there is a subject that you want to know more about.
Whatever it is, study it, and when you are done, share your thoughts with a friend or on social media, or maybe the bishopric will ask you to speak.
Who knows. But first, obtain the word, then share it.
