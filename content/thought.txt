"There are many voices today trying to lower our voices as disciples of Jesus Christ. The voices of the world are trying to silence us, but thatâ€™s exactly why we must declare our testimony of the Savior louder and stronger. Among all the voices of the world, the Lord is counting on me and you to declare our testimonies, to raise our voice, and to become His voice"
